# Google Homepage assignment

## Build the Google.com homepage (the front page)

This was the first TOP project that used basic HTML and CSS to recreate the Google homepage.

I completed the "easy" version. I made significant use of Grid and Flexbox, and I would likely do the same for the hard version as well.
